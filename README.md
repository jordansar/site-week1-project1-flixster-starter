### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the topics in the labs prepared me to be able to complete this assignent. A lot of the functions I used in this project were learned from the labs. For example, I learned how to use the addEventListener function, how to make a reference variable in the javascript, the fetch function that was used to get the movie data, and a lot more.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  If I had more time, I would've made sure to do a few more of the stretch features. They seemed pretty cool and I would've loved to try my best to implement them in my flixster. I aslo would've styled the movies in general, in a different way. Aside from that, I'm happy with the features I was able to implement with the time I had.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What went well with my project was that I was able to search efficiently. When I searched and then continued down to click the load more button, the movies that came after that were still related to the searched input that a user might've put in the search box. Some things that didn't go as planned for a while was the exit search button, which was supoposed to take the user back to the first page when clicked. Someone in the class made borders around their movie cards and they added keyframes to it so they would change color often. This is something I would like to try next time and see if I would be able to implement it in my own way.
